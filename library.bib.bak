abstract = {Here we present the first two-dimensional images of the virtual source of a supersonic helium expansion. The images were obtained using a free-standing Fresnel zone plate with an outermost zone width of 50 nm as imaging lens and a beam cooled to around 125 K. The nozzle diameter was 10 $\mu$m. The virtual source diameter was found to increase with stagnation pressure from 140 ± 30 $\mu$m at po = 21 bar up to 270 ± 25 $\mu$m at po = 101 bar. The experimental results are compared to a theoretical model based on the solution of the Boltzmann equation by the method of moments. The quantum mechanical cross sections used in the model have been calculated for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and the Hurly-Moldover (HM) potentials. By using a scaling of the perpendicular temperature that parametrizes the perpendicular velocity distribution based on a continuum expansion approach, the LJ potential shows a good overall agreement with the experiment. However, at higher pressures the data points lie in between the two theoretical curves and the slope of the trend is more similar to the HM curve. Real gas corrections to enthalpy are considered but they affect the results less than the experimental errors.},

The lifetimes of the first excited states in lithium, sodium, potassium and rubidium were measured with uncertainties ranging from ±0.14\% to ±0.25\%. The results are discussed in comparison with other recent experimental and theoretical work. The longstanding discrepancy between ab initio line strength calculations and the measurements of Gaupp et al. [Phys. Rev. A26 , 3351 (1982)] for the resonance transitions in lithium and sodium is resolved by the new measurements in favour of the theoretical calculations. Finally the role of the beam divergence in lifetime measurements on fast particle beams is discussed and a method to correct for this effect is presented. The importance of the beam divergence effect is illustrated by additional recent lifetime measurements on helium and on lithium.},

abstract = {In the present approach the high reliability of ab initio techniques is combined with the easily amenable phenomenological core polarization concept for an efficient treatment of intershell correlation effects in all‐electron SCF and valence CI calculations. By use of only a single adjustable atomic parameter, which is related to the radius of the core and determines the cutoff at short range, our effective core polarization potential (CPP) accounts quantitatively for dynamical intershell correlation as well as exclusion effects on the correlation energy of the core. The applications refer to alkali and alkaline earth atoms (Li to K and Be to Ca) and a detailed analysis is performed for core polarization effects on ionization energies, electron affinities, oscillator strengths, polarizabilities, van der Waals coefficients, the valence electron density, and spin densities. Very accurate results are obtained for well‐known energetic properties and spin densities at the nucleus. With respect to the other applications we consider our results as the most reliable to date with an estimated uncertainty of 1\%–2\%.},

A theoretical analysis has been made: this analysis supports the validity of the Saha-Langmuir law to relate the ionization probability to the work function.

@article{Bouchiat1999,
abstract = {Optical experiments have demonstrated cases in which mirror symmetry in stable atoms is broken during the absorption or emission of light. Such results, which are in conflict with quantum electrodynamics, support the theory of unification of the electromagnetic and weak interactions. The interpretation of the experimental results is based on exchanges of weak neutral Z/sub 0/ bosons between the electrons and the nucleus of the atom. A concise review of these phenomena in atomic physics is presented. The role of precise caesium parity-violation experiments, as a source of valuable information about electroweak physics, is illustrated by examples pertaining to experimental conditions which, in some cases, are not accessible to accelerator experiments. We give the basic principles of experiments, some under way and others completed, where a quantitative determination of the nuclear weak charge, Q/sub w/, which plays for the Z/sup 0/ exchange the same role as the electric charge for the Coulomb interaction is to be, or has been achieved. In the most recent and most precise experiment the accuracy on Q/sub w/ is limited to 1\% by the uncertainty due to atomic physics calculations. Such a result challenges specialists in atomic theory and nuclear structure, since a more accurate determination of Q/sub w/ would mean more stringent constraints upon possible extensions of the standard model. Moreover, clear evidence has recently been obtained for the existence of the nuclear anapole moment, which describes the valence electron interaction with a chiral nuclear-magnetization component induced by the parity-violating nuclear forces. In writing this review, our hope was to make clear that any improvement in atomic parity-violation measurements will allow the exploration of new areas of electroweak physics},

Dependence of an interaction induced phase on the atoms' velocity is compensated by applying an engineered counterphase. The counterphase is equivalent to a rotation, is precisely determined by a frequency, and can be used to measure phase shifts due to interactions of unknown strength. Phase shifts of 150 rad (5 times larger than previously possible) have now been measured in an atom beam interferometer, and we suggest that this technique can enable comparisons of atomic polarizability with precision of one part in 10,000.},

Using SD wave functions, accurate values of removal energies, electric-dipole matrix elements and static polarizabilities are obtained, however, SD wave functions give poor values of magnetic-dipole hyperfine constants for heavy atoms.

abstract = {Atomic polarization phenomena impinge upon a number of areas and processes in physics. The dielectric constant and refractive index of any gas are examples of macroscopic properties that are largely determined by the dipole polarizability. When it comes to microscopic phenomena, the existence of alkaline-earth anions and the recently discovered ability of positrons to bind to many atoms are predominantly due to the polarization interaction. An imperfect knowledge of atomic polarizabilities is presently looming as the largest source of uncertainty in the new generation of optical frequency standards. Accurate polarizabilities for the group I and II atoms and ions of the periodic table have recently become available by a variety of techniques. These include refined many-body perturbation theory and coupled-cluster calculations sometimes combined with precise experimental data for selected transitions, microwave spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms and ions, refractive index measurements in microwave cavities, ab initio calculations of atomic structures using explicitly correlated wave functions, interferometry with atom beams, and velocity changes of laser cooled atoms induced by an electric field. This review examines existing theoretical methods of determining atomic and ionic polarizabilities, and discusses their relevance to various applications with particular emphasis on cold-atom physics and the metrology of atomic frequency standards.},

abstract = {The average static (dc) electric dipole polarizabilities of the NaK and KCs heteronuclear alkali dimers have been measured, and those of the homonuclear molecules remeasured using molecular beam deflection in an inhomogeneous electric field. A congruent magnetic field enabled removal of the monomer constituents of the beam. The resulting deflection curves reflect both the permanent electric dipole force (for the heteronuclear dimers only), and the induced (polarizability) dipole force. It is assumed that the molecular constituents of the beam possess modified Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity and rotational state distributions. A Mach number is introduced to describe the sonic beam properties. The data analysis consists of a two‐parameter least squares best fit of the experimental deflection curves to computed ones, the parameters being the polarizability and the Mach number. Values of the permanent heteronuclear dipole moments are taken from the literature. The obtained static electric dipole polarizabilities in units of (\AA3) are 34±3 for Li2 (948 K), 40±3 for Na2 (676 K), 77±6 for K2 (542 K), 79±6 for Rb2 (527 K), 104±8 for Cs2 (480 K), 51±3 for NaK (612 K), and 89±5 for KCs (488 K).

By use of only a single adjustable atomic parameter, which is related to the radius of the core and determines the cutoff at short range, our effective core polarization potential (CPP) accounts quantitatively for dynamical intershell correlation as well as exclusion effects on the correlation energy of the core. The applications refer to alkali and alkaline earth atoms (Li to K and Be to Ca) and a detailed analysis is performed for core polarization effects on ionization energies, electron affinities, oscillator strengths, polarizabilities, van der Waals coefficients, the valence electron density, and spin densities. Very accurate results are obtained for well‐known energetic properties and spin densities at the nucleus.

abstract = {Using an atom interferometer, we have measured the static electric polarizability of \$\^{}7\$Li \$\backslash alpha =(24.33 \backslash pm 0.16)\backslash times10\^{}\{-30\} \$ m\$\^{}3\$ \$= 164.19\backslash pm 1.08 \$ atomic units with a 0.66\% uncertainty. Our experiment, which is similar to an experiment done on sodium in 1995 by D. Pritchard and co-workers, consists in applying an electric field on one of the two interfering beams and measuring the resulting phase-shift. With respect to D. Pritchard's experiment, we have made several improvements which are described in detail in this paper: the capacitor design is such that the electric field can be calculated analytically; the phase sensitivity of our interferometer is substantially better, near 16 mrad/\$\backslash sqrt\{Hz\}\$; finally our interferometer is species selective it so that impurities present in our atomic beam (other alkali atoms or lithium dimers) do not perturb our measurement. The extreme sensitivity of atom interferometry is well illustrated by our experiment: our measurement amounts to measuring a slight increase \$\backslash Delta v\$ of the atom velocity \$v\$ when it enters the electric field region and our present sensitivity is sufficient to detect a variation \$\backslash Delta v/v \backslash approx 6 \backslash times 10\^{}\{-13\}\$.},

abstract = {Interference with atomic and molecular matter waves is a rich branch of atomic physics and quantum optics. It started with atom diffraction from crystal surfaces and the separated oscillatory fields technique used in atomic clocks. Atom interferometry is now reaching maturity as a powerful art with many applications in modern science. In this review the basic tools for coherent atom optics are described including diffraction by nanostructures and laser light, three-grating interferometers, and double wells on atom chips. Scientific advances in a broad range of fields that have resulted from the application of atom interferometers are reviewed. These are grouped in three categories: (i) fundamental quantum science, (ii) precision metrology, and (iii) atomic and molecular physics. Although some experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates are included, the focus of the review is on linear matter wave optics, i.e., phenomena where each single atom interferes with itself.},

The following reduced matrix elements are determined < 6S\_\{1/2\} || D || 6P\_\{1/2\} > =4.5028(60) |e| a0 and < 6S\_\{1/2\} || D || 6P\_\{3/2\} > =6.3373(84) |e| a0 (a0= 0.529177 $\backslash$times 10\^{}\{-8\} cm.)

The ns and np atomic levels have the same ac Stark shifts at the corresponding magic wavelength, which facilitates state-insensitive optical cooling and trapping. Tune-out wavelengths for which the ground-state frequency-dependent polarizability vanishes are also calculated. Differences of these wavelengths between 6Li and 7Li are reported. Our approach uses high-precision, relativistic all-order methods in which all single, double, and partial triple excitations of the Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all orders of perturbation theory. Recommended values are provided for a large number of Li electric-dipole matrix elements. Static polarizabilities for the 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, and 3d levels are compared with other theory and experiment where available. Uncertainties of all recommended values are estimated. The magic wavelengths for the uv 2s-3p transition are of particular interest for the production of a quantum gas of lithium [ Duarte et al. Phys. Rev. A 84 061406R (2011)].},
